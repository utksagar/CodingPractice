1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,460
Pivot allows you to transpose Roe values into columns.

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:14,050
The syntax is quite complicated to look at first, but it becomes familiar with practice in your pre

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:14,860
pivot table.

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,900
You essentially have columns of interest.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,500
One column will contain the field you want to aggregate, along with the column that contains the values

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,030
you want to convert into columns.

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:33,310
So, for example, if you have a job column with Manager Plurk and President and values, it will convert

8
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,440
these values into their own columns.

9
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:44,870
In the pivot line, in the bottom you type pivot, followed by parentheses, you start with the aggregation

10
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:45,380
function.

11
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,820
Then type four, followed by the column, you want to pivot.

12
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,070
You then type.

13
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:03,330
In followed by the list of values in that column, inside parentheses, note that you cannot use a sub

14
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,140
query to generate that list.

15
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,740
It has to be typed in and finally right at the top.

16
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,410
We type select stock as this selects the pivoted columns.

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,130
OK.

18
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,640
So let's do an example, let me query the EPA under article countries table.

19
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:42,480
Now, what if I wanted a matrix of values showing me subregion along the roads and regionality along

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,080
the columns?

21
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,750
With the population totals as the values.

22
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,770
Well, we can use Pivot to do this.

23
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:05,280
So I can start by typing Select Star from and that is my top level select statement and in the first

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,130
parenthesis we type select followed by the columns of interest.

25
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:23,460
We would one region and subregion ID, as we need these for our Matrix film, and we also want to aggregate

26
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:30,240
the population field, so we want population to and it's from the EPA underscore countries table.

27
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,060
We now type in our pivot clothes.

28
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:45,220
Followed by the aggregation, which is the sum of population, and we're doing this for the region idee.

29
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:53,900
We then type in and type in the list of values in the region and field as they will be turned.

30
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,950
Intercoms.

31
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:08,360
You can do this by typing select distinct region, Heidi, from eBay and countries, and we will now

32
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,250
see a list of the values.

33
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,520
And there's only five.

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:24,230
So in my list, I can take 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and terminate with a semicolon and note, I would

35
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,630
have to include these in single quotes if they were character strings.

36
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,160
So let's it run.

37
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,050
OK, great.

38
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:40,970
So here's our matrix, and we can see that region 30 has a population of just over seven hundred million

39
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,290
for subregions.

40
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,310
One hundred and ten.

41
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,860
And around about one point nine billion for for subregion and 30.

42
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,640
So we now have a Matrix V.

43
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,560
And just to note that we chose the aggregation field to be population.

44
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,850
We can also choose it to be number of countries.

45
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,540
And if that's the case, we don't even need the population field.

46
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:13,040
We can actually just account for the region wide field.

47
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,730
And if I hit run again.

48
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:21,510
We now have the number of countries in The Matrix.

49
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,790
So there are five countries for regionality, 30 and subregion.

50
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,400
One hundred and ten and nine for region 30 and subregion 30.

51
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,110
So that was just a lecture showing you how to pivot your data.
