1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:08,570
Training enables you to remove leading and trailing characters such as whitespace from character strength.

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:17,820
The syntax is to type trem open parentheses, you then have the option to specify leading, which is

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,450
the start of the string trading, which is the end of the string or both, which is leading and trading.

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,090
The default is both if left blank.

5
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,820
So this is where it searches for your trim source.

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,340
The trim character is the character or characters to remove from your string.

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:45,060
So if you specify leading followed by lowercase s character, it will remove any lowercase S's at the

8
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,960
start of your string.

9
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:54,580
You then type from followed by the Transource characters should be enclosed in single quotes and the

10
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,870
default trim character is a white space.

11
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:03,400
This function is particularly useful if you want to remove trailing or leading white space.

12
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,520
OK, so let's query the table.

13
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:21,210
Let's say I wanted to remove the first letter of each employee that starts with K.

14
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:33,880
I can type select his name just so we can have that there was a reference to the letter K..

15
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,350
From his name.

16
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:47,450
So this is the Trem character and this is the dream source I haven't specified, leading or trailing,

17
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,870
so by default it's both.

18
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,400
And let's hear from.

19
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,110
And now King becomes a.

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,050
So let's use the dual table for some more examples.

21
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,610
Let's say I have a string with white space at the start and at the end of it, if I want to remove it,

22
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,630
I can type.

23
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:21,080
The white space has the trim character from and this is the actual trim source.

24
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,630
And now when I hit run.

25
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,950
We return white space with no white space, and I can make this even clearer by checking the length

26
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,250
of the.

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,500
So at prison, the length is ten characters.

28
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,770
And that is because he has removed leading and trailing whitespace, if I specify leading.

29
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,570
Then the length is 13, that is because it two.

30
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,020
Characters at the Star, which are white space, and they get removed, and in the end we have three

31
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,070
white space characters, so three plus the 10 four white space equals 13.

32
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,340
If I change this to trailing.

33
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,980
We get 12 because we remove the three white space characters at the end.

34
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,890
But retain the tube at the front.

35
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,410
Let's say you wanted to ensure all values in your field were of the same length will, you could put

36
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,650
them with characters to ensure that they are of the same length.

37
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:47,160
If the added value is below the required length, it will get padded either on the left or the right

38
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,350
side with the character that you specify.

39
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,110
If it exceeds the required length, then it gets truncated from either the left or the right side.

40
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,210
Both iPad and iPad take three expressions, the field with the values.

41
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,760
The length that the value should be after padding and the Pat character.

42
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,570
OK, so let's query the table.

43
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,070
Let's say I want the emperor to be five characters and it should have leadings, even if the emperor

44
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,300
does not have the required length of life I can select.

45
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,220
But because I want to pad on the left side.

46
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:44,270
The field, which is the length, which is five and the Pat character, which is over.

47
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,140
And he writes.

48
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,570
And now the empire is five characters.

49
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,060
Now, what if I want?

50
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:12,520
The job field to be a maximum six characters, if it's less than six characters and padded with a capital

51
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,980
X on the right side.

52
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,200
So what I can do is select Chaubey for comparison and then I go to Arpad.

53
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:31,400
The field, which is the length, which is six and the character X and.

54
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:44,580
So now where the original field exceeds six characters, it gets truncated and where it's below six

55
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,320
characters like Clerck, it gets padded with a capital X.

56
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,190
Now for the final example.

57
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,300
So let's say the salary field is in thousands and I want to add three zeros to the end.

58
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:13,010
I can just type Arpad cell and for the length I can specify the length of the Southy field plus three,

59
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,800
because whatever the length is, I want to add three to the end of it, followed by zero.

60
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,210
And now we have to value with three zeros added at the end of each of it.

61
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,270
OK, so that was showing you how to use trim and pad.
