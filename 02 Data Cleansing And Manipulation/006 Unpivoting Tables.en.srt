1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,170
Pivot transforms columns into rows.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:11,050
This will create two new columns, one column will contain the previous column names which you can use

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,870
and another will contain the aggregated values from the pivot view.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,320
The syntax for unbefitting a table is to first select all columns from the pivot table.

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,830
You then type on pivo and open parentheses.

6
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,130
You went to the name that you would like to give, the column that holds the measures.

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,940
This is a new column that will be created, followed by the full keyword and the name of the column

8
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,510
that you want to hold the existing pivoted column names.

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,940
This will hold these values his record.

10
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,290
You then type in and list out each of the column names.

11
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:57,820
You can aliased them to that select star from table at the top, as I mentioned, will just select the

12
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,080
unpiloted table.

13
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,190
OK, so let's give an example, I'm going to create a table.

14
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:23,710
And it will contain the average test scores for three classrooms across three subjects maths, science

15
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,360
and English.

16
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:31,360
So the first problem will be class and it will be a virtual 10 day to time.

17
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:37,720
The second column will be called Maths, and it will be another day to type.

18
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,940
The third column will be science and it will be a no later time.

19
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,440
And the fourth column will be English and it will be a no later type.

20
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,040
And now I will insert values

21
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,340
into this into the table.

22
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,650
So for the first class will be seven a.

23
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:18,260
And the schools will be 70, 50, 80, and I will enter that, I will copy that three times.

24
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,180
I will change this to be 70 and 70.

25
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:40,800
And the scores will be 80, 80, 90, 70, 80, let's say 67.

26
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,190
And 89 and I will insert these three values.

27
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,980
Values keyword here.

28
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,610
And I'll insert these three into the table.

29
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,630
OK, so let's query a table.

30
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,330
So we have the three classrooms.

31
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:29,120
And the average results in maths, science and English, so this is a matrix.

32
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:37,950
Well, what if instead I wanted to transform this so that the data for test scores and subject were

33
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,760
in two columns?

34
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:49,100
One column showing the subject and another showing the average school voter on Pivot the table, we

35
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,950
can type select stuff from average test scores.

36
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,700
And then on Pivot.

37
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,420
So first, we type the name for the field containing our measure, which is called our average school.

38
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,270
Followed by the 40 foot.

39
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,870
And then the column that holds the values, math, science and English, we can call that subject,

40
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:28,100
we type in keyword and now we can type the column names math, science and English in a list for the

41
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,280
Jader and Germany.

42
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,570
And I once I hit run.

43
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,460
We have our data on pivoted.

44
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:45,920
We can also aliased these records so I can change formats as mathematics and.

45
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,350
And now that has changed as mathematics.
