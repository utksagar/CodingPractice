1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:07,340
The greatest and least functions take a list of expressions and return either the lowest or highest

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,450
value from that list.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,510
This can be useful if you want to cap a salary, for example, no one should earn less than five hundred

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,850
or higher than three thousand.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,350
The first expression in that list is used to determine the date to type.

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:33,020
The syntax for greatest and least is to put in a list of expressions inside the parentheses.

7
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,250
OK, so let's query the table.

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,990
So I want to call them that does not allow the salary to be higher than three thousand.

9
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,090
And if it is, then it cuts it to that value of three thousand so I can select.

10
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:04,360
All the fields from the table, followed by the least function in my list, Putzel and three thousand.

11
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:15,410
And as you can see, the lowest value out of the salary of three thousand has been displayed in each

12
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,520
room and in this instance, three thousand is lower than five thousand.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,080
So it's been displayed.

14
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:29,440
Now, what if nobody should be paid less than one thousand more than I can change this to the greatest

15
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,880
and this to be one thousand?

16
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,900
So now the higher of salary or 1000 will be populated.

17
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,440
And now Smith has a salary of one thousand rather than eight hundred.
