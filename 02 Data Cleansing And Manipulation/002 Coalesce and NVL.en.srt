1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:06,190
I want to talk about two functions that can handle null values in your data sets, we'll be using these

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:10,060
functions throughout the course and being able to handle no values is very important.

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:18,490
Coalesce takes two or more expressions, and for each role, it returns the first value from these expressions

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,630
that is not null.

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:27,530
So let's say you have two problems, first name and nickname, sometimes you find that the first name

6
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:33,380
is left blank and when it's left blank, usually it's because the first name is in the nickname fueled

7
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,100
by accident.

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:42,360
You can create a column using coalesce to return the first name, if it is not null, otherwise return

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,430
the nickname if the first name is no.

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:51,210
So as you can imagine, the ordering is important as it will take the value from the first expression

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,410
that is not null.

12
00:00:53,650 --> 00:01:00,220
If all of the expressions are no, then it will return all the data types in each expression must also

13
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:00,690
be the same.

14
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:06,400
You can't have a numerical data type in the first expression and a character to type in the next.

15
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:14,420
The syntax for coalesce is to have coalesce, open parenthesis and list all of the expressions you'd

16
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,230
like to include.

17
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,750
OK, so let's query our table.

18
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:36,400
I want to column that will return either the Web address first.

19
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,940
And if there is no Web address, then return the story.

20
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,550
So I can type.

21
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:58,950
Select name, web address and then coalesce and the first expression, because, remember, ordering

22
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:08,760
is important is Web address and then if that's no, then provide the store name and hit run.

23
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:17,920
As you can see in the first row, we have the Web address, the remaining rows for the Web address on

24
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:18,240
now.

25
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,850
So the story has been populated instead.

26
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,340
So let's see what happens if I swap the expressions around and I have stoning first.

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,270
Now, basically, we return all the store names in the store name field, including online rather than

28
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:44,930
the Web address.

29
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,330
So this is just a reminder that the ordering is important, store name is prioritized because it's first

30
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,810
and since then has no null values.

31
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,210
The Web address field is not used at all.

32
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,780
OK, so let's now add another expression storewide.

33
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:14,290
Now, this time we get an error because storewide is a numeric data type.

34
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,930
So we must ensure that all of the expressions are of the same data type.

35
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,380
Never takes no values from an expression and replaces it with a specified strain.

36
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,170
So, for example, if you wanted all no values to be zero, instead, you can do that.

37
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:44,570
If the expression in the first parameter is a character, then it converts the replacement stream to

38
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,200
a character.

39
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,270
If it's numeric, then it's a bit more complicated, but usually convert it into a numeric data type.

40
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,780
So here's the syntax for Engvall.

41
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,180
It takes an expression which is usually a field, and then you type your replacement string.

42
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,600
OK, so let's clear we are on the table.

43
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:27,150
In the cornfield, we have notes for commissions for many employees, let's replace these novels with

44
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:27,570
zero.

45
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:39,820
So I will alias the asterisk and then I'll do Annville com, which is the field and then the replacement,

46
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,910
which is zero for unknown values.

47
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,410
And here.

48
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:53,310
And now, as you can see in our field, we have zeros instead of the normal values.

49
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,690
Now, let's try to replace this with the string no commission.

50
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:12,160
We get an error as it must be the same data type uncombed only takes numeric values.

51
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:20,670
So we can replace strength with character data types and the string must be enclosed in single words,

52
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:26,040
if we do so, let me select Star from Impaction.

53
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:36,350
And now what I'll do is I'll insert a record into the table and I'll leave the E name has no.

54
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,590
So I will type insert into AMP.

55
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,000
Valli's.

56
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,660
Zero techno, no.

57
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,590
Which is a test for the job manager, right?

58
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:09,300
Zero system with Heidi, thousand for the salary, no for the commission and 10 for the Depner and.

59
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:19,270
OK, so now a redemptive looking.

60
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:30,130
And at this time, I want to replace I want to use the anvil function on the Inamed field, unpopulated,

61
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,490
with no name instead of any no values.

62
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:40,030
So I can type select your name and feel your name.

63
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:46,750
And now this time I enclose in single vote because I'm entering a string and I'll take no name.

64
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,320
And as you can see, we have no name instead.

65
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,310
So now let me just delete the record I inserted.

66
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,390
There we go.
