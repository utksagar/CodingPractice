1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:09,700
So first off, run the Esquibel command to prepare for this assignment, so run them one at a time.

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,470
So first I'll create the table.

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,470
Then I will insert each record.

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:19,940
Into the table.

5
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,300
So now I'll query the table.

6
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:47,210
So from the solution, we can see that we want the column holding the number of goals to be called goals

7
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:54,770
and the column holding the years to be called season, and it also appears that the season and values

8
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,670
have been aliased.

9
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,390
So year twenty eighteen is aliased to twenty eighteen.

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,090
To take one pill at this table, we type until after the next afternoon goes preseason.

11
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,880
And we had goals as the name of the column that contains the aggregated measure.

12
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,210
For.

13
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:27,810
And then season is the name of the new column that holds the existing column names in and then we write

14
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:39,080
here twenty eighteen as twenty eighteen year and school twenty nineteen has twenty nineteen.

15
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,160
Yeah, twenty twenty has twenty twenty.

16
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,690
And here, right?

17
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,170
And here are our results, uninhibited.
