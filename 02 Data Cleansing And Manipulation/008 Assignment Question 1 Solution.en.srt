1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:07,420
OK, so before we actually write our pivot query, let's check the distinctive values in the job column

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,910
as that's the column we're pivoting.

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:25,340
So the distinctive values are analyst, clerck, salesman, manager and president.

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,080
OK, so now let's build our query.

5
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:40,070
So we select staff from and then in our first select statement inside the parentheses, we're interested

6
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,570
in the depth field.

7
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:53,920
Job and sell the debt and job will form the rows and columns of our matrix and the cell will be aggregated

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,330
from the table.

9
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,200
We then type pivot.

10
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:10,250
Well, aggregation is the sum of cell four and then the field, which we're pivoting, which is job,

11
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:16,490
we specify the keyword and then list out the values in the job column.

12
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,040
We do this in single quotes because it's character data type analyst,

13
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,540
Plurk

14
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,290
salesman, manager.

15
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,910
And president.

16
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,870
And hit one.

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,720
And here is our result.
