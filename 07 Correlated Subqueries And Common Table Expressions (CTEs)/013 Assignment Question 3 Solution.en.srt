1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:08,750
OK, so for this question, we need to use a recursive cty and have Jones as the anchor result, we

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:14,600
then have to have a join in the recursive clause, part of the sub query, where we join the table to

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:21,010
the city based on the emperor of the city to be the manager ID in the table.

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,060
We then add another field, called it on the school.

5
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,410
No, so we can see which iteration number each result is from.

6
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:42,470
So we can type with and I'll call it qty underscore and and have employee in manager and later on the

7
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:50,210
school known as Select and no e name manager.

8
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:56,950
And I'll give the Italo a scalar value of one for the anchor result.

9
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,130
From.

10
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,260
And where e name equals Jones.

11
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:24,100
Within the union and then for the recursive clause we select and to enter and name and DOE manager and

12
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:36,450
then qty underscore ampe to end plus one from Qty, underscore and join in on qty underscore ampe.

13
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:47,020
And no equals and don't manager, we then select staff from our city.

14
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,290
And here on.

15
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,940
I'm sorry they should be on this call.

16
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,590
No.

17
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,400
And here on.

18
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,970
And now here are results we can see Jones as part of the anchor query, is in the first iteration and

19
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,090
then Scott and forward report into Jones.

20
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,710
As part of the second iteration.

21
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,650
And then the third iteration, we have Adams and Smith, who report to Scott and Ford as part of the

22
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:31,290
final iteration and after Adams and Smith do not have manager, it's because Adams and Smith are not

23
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,330
managers to any other employees.

24
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,370
So what iteration and.
