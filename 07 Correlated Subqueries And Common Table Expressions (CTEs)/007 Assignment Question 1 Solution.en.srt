1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:07,710
So we can address this using a correlated sub query, we want to query the AMP table as the outer query,

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:16,650
but only return those records where there exists a manager right for this employee's employee ID so

3
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:35,820
we can select staff from an alias that as a worker exists select manager from and B, where a DOT employee

4
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,850
equals B, dot manager.

5
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,330
And here on.

6
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,970
Here are results.

7
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,290
So there are six employees who are also managers.

8
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:58,980
And again, it doesn't matter what we put in the select field because we're testing for existence where

9
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,920
the employee on the table also equals the manager on the table.
