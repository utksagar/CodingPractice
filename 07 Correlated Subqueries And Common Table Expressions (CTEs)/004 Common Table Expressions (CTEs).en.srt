1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:08,100
A common table expression is a named ResultSet that exists temporarily as a table space and can be referred

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,020
to later in a select statement.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:18,340
Because the city is stored as a table, space is retrieved from this table space rather than the base

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,550
tables used to create the CTY.

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:28,580
This can be beneficial when you have to reference the same table or query many times in a select statement.

6
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:38,720
The syntax for Qty is to type with, followed by the catchy name, you can then specify the column names

7
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,970
followed by the ASCII word.

8
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:48,900
You then open parentheses and type your select insert update or delete statement and then close the

9
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,710
parentheses.

10
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,340
You then finally select your columns by referencing the city itself.

11
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:03,570
I'm going to create a city which is just the empty table where the salaries are above two thousand.

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:12,660
So I'll type with followed by the city name and I'll just call it City Underscore School and I'll give

13
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,040
it four columns.

14
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:14,940
You name.

15
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:16,740
No.

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,500
Sal and Deb.

17
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:31,460
No, I'll type as followed by the subquery used to create the city, which will be Select Your Name

18
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:39,530
and Sal Adeptness from tempt fate Sal is created.

19
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,370
And two thousand.

20
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:51,420
And finally, I will select all columns referencing the city, notice that the select statement is referencing

21
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,180
the city and state run.

22
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,170
Here are all of our results where the salary is greater than two thousand.

23
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:09,920
We can also create multiple cities and separate them with commerce and perform selects on them.

24
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,200
Let's say I want to join all employees that have a salary of over 2000 to all departments that are either

25
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,850
in 10 or 20.

26
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:26,460
Well, I can create two cities and then perform a joint on both of these CTD.

27
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,390
So I can type a comma after my first S.T..

28
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:40,870
Type in the name of my new city, which, of course, city underscored that give a field of known as

29
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:52,030
Select Depner from Depth where depth and 10 and 20.

30
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,720
I will then finally perform and select on this, where I will select all records from the first city,

31
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,830
which of course Qty underscore EMP and Aliased as a.

32
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:15,510
And then I will then join in on the Second City Qty on this quartet, which are ASSP and I'll do the

33
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,630
join a quartet.

34
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,090
No, because they don't Depner.

35
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:22,550
And here.

36
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:32,760
And here are our results, all salaries greater than two thousand belonging to debt to know 10 or 20.

37
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,460
So that was just a short lecture on creating a common table expressions.
