1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:08,910
OK, so for this question, we need to use a recursive cty and have Klok as the anchor Resul.

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:18,820
We then need to join in the recursive search query and we join the AMP table to the city based on the

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:25,140
employee of the city to be the same as the manager right on the table.

4
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:39,340
So we type with S.T. on the score and give it three columns and know your name and manager as.

5
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:54,370
And so my anchor query, I'll type, select and pronounce your name manager from and where e name

6
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,980
equals clock union.

7
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:17,350
OK, and then select and don't no amp to rename AMP top manager.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,830
From city to school and which is referencing the sub query.

9
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,950
Join and on Qty on this Klemp.

10
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:47,000
To employee equals camp dot manager and I then select staff from city school and.

11
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,970
And here, Ron.

12
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,030
So we now return clock along with his direct report, Milla.

13
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:06,090
And no, if you got the same result with a slightly different query, that's also fine.
