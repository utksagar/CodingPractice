1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:06,080
Let's now move on to using range to define our window frame.

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:16,910
I want to partition by regionality and order by subregions, it but first let's select all the columns

3
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:17,990
from our countries table.

4
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:37,970
And now for the analytical function of some population, again, over partition by region wide order

5
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,060
by sub region it.

6
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:51,790
And define the range between one proceeding and one following.

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,760
As a.

8
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:03,070
From EPA, undisclosed countries and here.

9
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:16,530
So now we're using values from the subregion, it in our range as that is in the autobio clause.

10
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,770
So by saying one proceeding and one following, it means that when we are looking at subregion it of

11
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,470
ten, we're looking for the range in each individual partition.

12
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,870
With the subregion, it is nine and 11.

13
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,570
So when we were in and it when we were in the region, 90, 10 partition.

14
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,990
We can see subregion ID 10 and the next subregion, it is 80.

15
00:01:53,620 --> 00:02:01,150
So we don't have one proceeding and one following in this context, because 80 is actually 70 following

16
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:01,690
10.

17
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,920
So this valley, which is six hundred and forty eight million.

18
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:14,190
Just takes the value from the current range, which will be the regionality 10 and the subregion region

19
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,120
10.

20
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,630
So let's try Zevo proceeding.

21
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:29,720
And 74 following, because we know in our petition for Region 10, we have subregion eight, 10 and

22
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,090
subregion ID 80.

23
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:40,280
So if I do zero proceeding and 70 following, I expect this value for the partition region at 10 and

24
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:48,380
subregion 80 10 to increase to be the total for region and 10 because 70 following, which is 10 plus

25
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,690
70 is 80.

26
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,830
So let's test that theory.

27
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,050
I'll just copy this, Al.

28
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:03,680
We need to be 10 years zero preceding and 70 following.

29
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,650
Get rid of that comma and run.

30
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,950
And now, as you can see.

31
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,700
You'll recognize that just over one billion is actually the total for each night 10.

32
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,390
And if I scroll down.

33
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,430
Six for eight million plus three six, seven million.

34
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,960
Is this value over here?

35
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,350
And when we are in the context of Canada, which is.

36
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,020
So which is region wide 10 and subregion 80.

37
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:49,890
We get the same value, and this is because zero preceding 80 is 80 and 70, following would be one

38
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,700
hundred and fifty.

39
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:59,370
But we don't have subregion ID in the range of 80 to 150 as we go to the next partition.

40
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:07,750
So we know the value here, we just take the value for Regenhard 10 and subregion 80.
