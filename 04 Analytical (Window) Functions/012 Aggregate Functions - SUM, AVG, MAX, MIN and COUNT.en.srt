1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,390
So, as you know, in all of our previous examples, we've used the some aggregation function, but

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,360
now let's go over the other aggregation functions as well.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,990
In some examples, we'll use the country's table and will apply the aggregation functions on the population

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,400
field.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,940
So let's try to select a name which is the country name.

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,700
I also had regionality.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:34,010
And now I'll apply the same aggregation which we've already been using, and to make this an analytical

8
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:40,720
function, I'll use the clues, but I won't specify anything inside the over clause.

9
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:46,940
So this analytical function will be applied across the entire table, and I'll do that for the rest

10
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,410
of the aggregations as well.

11
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,230
From eBay, undisclosed countries, let's hit, run.

12
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,480
Hyperbola.

13
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,950
I mean.

14
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:35,670
Greg.

15
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,580
OK, so as I said, because we've applied the over clause.

16
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,170
And no parameters within the over clause.

17
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:56,870
These aggregation functions are applied to the entire table, so the sum of the population for all countries

18
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,370
is seven point seven billion.

19
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:04,400
The minimum population is zero, the maximum population is one point four billion.

20
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,210
There are two hundred and forty nine votes and the average population is approximately thirty one million.

21
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:25,580
OK, so now let's apply a partition in our over clause, we will partition by region it and I will copy

22
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:25,880
that

23
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,240
into all of the analytical functions.

24
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,610
And here are.

25
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:46,300
So now this time we are partitioning by region, and so the sum of the population for region wide 10

26
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,560
is one billion.

27
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,480
The minimum population is zero.

28
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,980
The maximum population is three hundred and twenty nine million.

29
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:03,070
There are fifty seven countries in Region 10 and the average average population is approximately 17

30
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,460
million.

31
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,100
If I now go down to the next region.

32
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,650
The values change.

33
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:19,610
So the population is now what looks to be seven hundred and forty seven million, the minimum population

34
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,530
is a seven hundred and ninety nine.

35
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,620
The maximum population is one hundred and forty five million.

36
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,720
Two hundred forty six million approximately.

37
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:34,460
There are fifty one countries and the average population is lower than region ten at approximately fourteen

38
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,050
point seven million.
