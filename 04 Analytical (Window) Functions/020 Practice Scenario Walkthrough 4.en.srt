1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:09,490
For this scenario, let's order our countries by population in ascending order and create a running

2
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:16,460
total for the population which keeps adding on the next country's population as we go down to.

3
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,930
So what you need to do here is select the country's name.

4
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:34,180
Population and then use the some aggregation on population followed by the other groups.

5
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:45,500
Order by population ascending, just type AFSC, and that would be the default as well.

6
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:56,850
And then for hour window frame, we type Veronese between inbounded proceeding and current row.

7
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:09,610
And we'll call this a running total population from Epper underscore countries.

8
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,550
And let me just increase.

9
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,700
The road limit to five hundred.

10
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:32,700
And now we have the running total in the last column that is increasing as we go down each road and

11
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,490
adding on the population of the next country.

12
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,800
And as we get to the end, we have the total population of seven point seven billion.

13
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:52,490
I know that we could have just defined our window frame as Rose Inbounded proceeding, and it would

14
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,780
have given us the same result.
