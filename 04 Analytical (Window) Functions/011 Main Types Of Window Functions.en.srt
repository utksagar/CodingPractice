1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:06,350
We've already been using the some aggregation function in our previous window, close examples, and

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,820
there are different categories of different window functions.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,800
We have aggregate functions such as some average Max Min account.

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,030
We have ranking functions such as row number, rank and then rank.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,400
We also have distribution functions such as percent rank and cumulative distribution, analytical functions

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,600
include lead, lag, entail and value.

7
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,020
In the next four lectures, I will be discussing the four types of window functions in detail.
