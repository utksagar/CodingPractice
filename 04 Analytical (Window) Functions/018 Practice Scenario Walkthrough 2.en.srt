1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:07,940
For this scenario, let's arrange our countries in order of population from largest, smallest and find

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:13,460
the difference between the population of the current country and the one after it.

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:24,580
So to do this, we can use the lead function, so let's select the country and the population for that

4
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,160
country and our analytical function.

5
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,290
So in the parameters, I would like population.

6
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,540
Because that is the field that I would like the lead function to pick up.

7
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:48,210
One, because that's the offset I would like one after the current, and that is the value by default.

8
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,050
So even if you leave it blank, it will be the same.

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:03,980
And individuals, I would just like to order my population sending from EPA and school countries.

10
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:08,000
Now, again, we haven't finished our query, but I just want to see what it looks like.

11
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,870
And as you can see.

12
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,490
The lead function brings the population of the country below the current rate.

13
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:28,010
And now what we need to do is subtract our analytical function to the population for the current role

14
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:36,860
to determine the variance, so copy into an equal amount to population minus the analytical function,

15
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,950
and I'll use that as variant.

16
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:53,410
So now we can see that the population of China is approximately six hundred and seventy million more

17
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:00,280
than the population of India and the population of India is approximately one billion more than the

18
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,010
population of the USA.
