1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,300
For the following assignment, questions will be using the customer orders data model specifically will

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,650
be creating a view that combines the orders table and the order items table.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,920
Now, I'll show you how to create this view, so please make sure you're following along with the code

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,760
I'm about to run.

5
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,630
Otherwise, you'll not be able to do the assignment questions.

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,930
Now, I want to create a view that contains all the data from the orders table.

7
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:40,600
But what we're missing from the audit table is the total order value, and that information is in the

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,650
order items table.

9
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:52,760
So what we need at an older level is the unit price times the quantity to give us the total order value.

10
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:00,110
So what I want to do is join the orders table to the order items table and create a view from this joint,

11
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,170
but I can't just join the orders table to the order items table because the order I.D. is not unique

12
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,400
in the order items table.

13
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,800
So I'll need to group it before I can do the joint and I can group it on order.

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,700
So first for the query.

15
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:26,870
I'll select and leave, the column is blank for now, what I know is I want to select orders as I left

16
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,230
table.

17
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,850
I'll use that as a.

18
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,970
And it doesn't really matter what kind of joint I do, because I know that the order I.D. will match

19
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:43,630
on the orders table and the order items table, but I'll do a left joint, so left joint and this needs

20
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,560
to be on subquery.

21
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:57,280
So I'll select order ID and then the son of the unit price times quantity and I'll alias that.

22
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:12,310
As for the total from order items and group that I order, underscore it and is the sub query as B and

23
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,080
the joint will be done on a tall order, it equals B..

24
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,630
The order idee.

25
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,860
Now, one other thing to note is a very select staff from orders.

26
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,540
Is that I want the order status to be complete.

27
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,980
I do not want to include incomplete or refunded orders.

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:50,720
So a lot of vehicles here to say where a to order status equals and caps complete.

29
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,680
Now for the fields, I'd like all the fields here from the oldest table, so I'll type a star, use

30
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:10,610
a wild card and from the subquery, which I'm performing the joint on, all I really want is this order

31
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,030
total.

32
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,620
So let's run this query.

33
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,620
I know it's not been created as a verb yet.

34
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,560
Here is our results.

35
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,670
And as you can see, we've got the Oldroyd with the total for that order.

36
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:40,300
So now to create The View, I'll put this query in brackets.

37
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:52,010
And I'll write crazy and I'll call my veto orders as.

38
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,230
Terminate with the semicolon and execute this whole query that has been created.

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,680
If I go in to my object browser filter by these.

40
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,580
You should have a veto orders.

41
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,000
The.

42
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,600
OK, great.

43
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,940
So now we're ready to move on to the assignment questions, I've included a healthy number of these

44
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,550
because I believe the best way to master analytical functions is with practice.

45
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,120
So don't worry, if you find some of these questions difficult, review the solutions and make sure

46
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,290
you understand the logic.

47
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,960
And like I said, keep on practicing.
