1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:09,170
So for this question, we need to first define a window frame using ranges and order or data based on

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:09,770
month and year.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,220
So we can use the to try to function again to get the month in year combination, but we cannot apply

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,400
this to arrange range window frame because ranges do not accept characters.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:32,520
So we can be a bit creative here and convert or to CHA output to a no output and use a format mask that

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,780
suits this requirement.

7
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:43,420
So let me show you so I'll select order date time from the borders.

8
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:58,530
Now I can use that to try to convert this order the daytime into four digit year and a month combination.

9
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:07,590
And will this although this looks like in America after the trial function and choose, it's a character

10
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:15,450
out there so I can then use the two number function to convert this to a number?

11
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:23,020
And now we can apply a range window frame, we're using ranges instead of rows because we're interested

12
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,520
in the entire value for the current month and year.

13
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:35,420
So when we're on September of 2020, we want to calculate the total for September 2020 as this group.

14
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,470
And if we subtract one from this, it will be.

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,160
August of twenty twenty.

16
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:49,810
Whereas if we were to use Rose, we would only be doing this at every level, so ranges suit our requirements.

17
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,920
So the following month is one unit higher and the previous month is one unit lower.

18
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,400
Great.

19
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,540
So let's start populating our query.

20
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:11,510
I would like to order it and I'm just going to copy this and for output I'll leave.

21
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:17,990
This is to try and convert this to a month in year combination for readability.

22
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:29,450
And I'll also get the order total and now for our window function, I'd like to use the average segregation

23
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:35,870
on the order total over partition.

24
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,340
By.

25
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,100
Would the date time in the year and month former?

26
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,110
Order by the same.

27
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,360
And use the range as to proceed.

28
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,540
This is the same as saying range between two preceding and current road.

29
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,520
And I'll use this as average three months.

30
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,500
And now I can take the order total and subtract that.

31
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,600
From this window function.

32
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,170
An 80s that has variants.

33
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,250
And here, Ron.

34
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:44,520
So now you can see that the average three months for March of twenty twenty is one hundred and sixty

35
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,540
four point seven.

36
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:53,800
And the variance in the current rose context is thirty four point seven, and that will continue.

37
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,840
As we go down to the next valley, which is April 20, 20, and that will take the rolling average,

38
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:06,360
and because we've only got one month previous to that, that will be the rolling average of March and

39
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:06,750
April.

40
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,720
So this question was a little bit trickier, and we had to be a bit creative in terms of getting our

41
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:15,890
out.

42
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,900
This isn't the only way to get the result.

43
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,610
This is just one of the ways.

44
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,560
And if you find a more creative way, then that's also fine.
