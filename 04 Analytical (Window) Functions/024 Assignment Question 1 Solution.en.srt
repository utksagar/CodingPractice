1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,050
So to do this, we need to select the order idee.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:17,460
The customer ready and we can use the rank function in our analytical function, partitioned by customer

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,710
ID and order

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,090
by order, total descending.

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,580
And the descending is very important because we want to order it from highest to lowest.

6
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,040
From our view, the underscore order's inherent.

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,150
So now we can see.

8
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:53,270
For each customer ID, so for customer ID one, we've got all their distinct orders.

9
00:00:54,470 --> 00:01:00,980
And I should actually probably include order total so we can see what the actual order total is.

10
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,540
We can see it's a range from highest to lowest and then we start again as we get to the next customer

11
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:07,900
ID.

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,060
And again, to the next customer, Edy.
