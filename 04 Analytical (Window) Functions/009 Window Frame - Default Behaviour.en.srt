1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:06,200
So I appreciate that might be a lot to take in, but let's run through some examples using our country's

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:06,600
table.

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:14,120
Let's first look at how the default window frame works when we don't specify anything for the window

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,420
frame.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:22,520
So let's type select name, which is the country name region.

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:28,560
Underscore it because that's what we're going to partition by subregion underscore.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,000
Right.

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:36,890
Because that's what we can order by the population, because that's what we're going to do our analytical

9
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:37,550
function on.

10
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:45,920
And then the first analytical function, which will be some of population

11
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:48,950
over.

12
00:00:51,730 --> 00:01:02,440
Partition by region underscore it, and I'll include an order by clause, sub, underscore region,

13
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,920
underscore it, but I won't specify a window frame.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,080
All alias.

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,930
This is a.

16
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:20,840
I'll do another analytical function where I'll do some of population over partition by region, underscore

17
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:31,310
it, and this time I won't specify an order by or the window frame and I'll add that as be and will

18
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,090
type from every underscore countries.

19
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,520
And let me just select 500000.

20
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,760
And here right now, let's evaluate our results.

21
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,900
So I want you to understand the difference between the columns A and B.

22
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:03,360
For both, we have not specified the actual window frame for column A. We have partition by region and

23
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,960
order by subregion subregions.

24
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,250
Since we've specified the order by.

25
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:18,450
But not defying the window frame, the range is between unbounded preceding and current.

26
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:41,170
Whereas for Colombe, we specified the partition by, but we've not specified the order by or the window

27
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:41,500
frame.

28
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:53,650
So the default for that would be rose, unbounded proceeding and inbounded following, so Colombe continues

29
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,330
the summation for the entire partition.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,340
So this value, which is just over one billion, is the sum of the population for region ICD 10.

31
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:18,250
And as we get to a new region, it it then takes the sum of region into 20, whereas for column A,

32
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,410
we continue the partition.

33
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,680
Until we get to a new subregion, I'd say this some.

34
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,240
Would be for regionality 10 and subregion ID 10.

35
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,460
So then it's currently six hundred and forty million.

36
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:48,900
And as we get to subregion, I'd 80, the value goes up.

37
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:59,210
To one million, to over one billion, so it takes the value for subregion ID 10.

38
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,700
And it adds it to the value for some reason.

39
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:12,900
So it continues something on because remember, it's doing range inbounded proceeding and current road.

40
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:22,200
So when you're at Canada, which is regionality 10 and subregion 80, inbounded proceeding would also

41
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,750
include subregion 10.

42
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,720
And as we get to a new partition, we start again.

43
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:38,560
So this Time column, again, is lower than Colombia because Colombia has calculated the population

44
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:46,900
for the entire partition of Region 20, whereas so far Column A. has only calculated the sum of population

45
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,820
for region in the 20 and subregion 70.

46
00:04:51,520 --> 00:05:00,430
So as we go down to the next subregion and we're still in partition for region 80-20, we continue to

47
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,880
add on and it slowly will accumulate.

48
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,370
Until we get the same value in both columns.

49
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,840
So I hope you understand what's going on with Columns A and B.
