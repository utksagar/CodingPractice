00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,360
This lecture is critical to mastering analytical functions.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:12,070
So please make sure you follow along after you apply your partitions and order by Krause's, you have

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,420
to define a window frame.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,160
The window frame defines the rows that are used in the analytical function.

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:25,930
So if we use to some aggregation, then for each partition of the table, the window frame defines which

6
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:32,900
rose to some, hence the term window frame in a partition as you move down each room.

7
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,290
You have the current rows and you have the rows which are preceding the current row, and you also have

8
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,510
the rows which are following the current row.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,680
Of course, if your current role is at the top or bottom of the partition, then there are no preceding

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,590
or following roles.

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,780
So in the illustration, we have a partition from a table.

12
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,210
In that partition, we have the current.

13
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,850
And then you have another group that is in rose above it in the partition.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,990
We turn that as in proceeding.

15
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,430
So if it was two rows proceeding, we would say two proceeding.

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:16,280
You have another group that comes and goes after and we say and following, if it came three weeks after,

17
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,750
we would take three following.

18
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,220
The same applies for every single politician.

19
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,170
This slide shows the definitions of the different bounds, all definitions include the current.

20
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,970
I've attached this slide as a resource to this lecture.

21
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:46,690
So you already know what roads are in a table, a range is a value, and in your window frame you include

22
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,530
all roads where the value is within that defined range.

23
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,960
I will elaborate on this shortly.

24
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:01,000
When defining just one bound you type rows or range, followed by the bound.

25
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:08,210
For example, Rose, one proceeding or range, one proceeding.

26
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:17,340
When defining lower and upper bounds, you type the rows or range followed by the between Keywood.

27
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,700
The lower bound and the upper bound.

28
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,340
The lower bound must come before the upper bound.

29
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:34,400
So in the left side, we have an extract of a table partition, this is fake data and has not been extracted

30
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,420
from the country's table.

31
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,430
It's just, for example, purposes.

32
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:45,590
We've tried to get the some of the population partitioned by region and ordered by subregion ID and

33
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,800
defined the window frame as rose unbounded preceding.

34
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:57,060
The table is the partition four way region, it equals 20, so it's looking at the partition where region

35
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,930
it is 20.

36
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:06,010
This means that for the some of the population, the window frame is all the rows before the current

37
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,500
row and the current row itself.

38
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,430
Which you can see highlighted in the green box.

39
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,160
And if you take the total.

40
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,830
The sum would be fifty eight million, five hundred thousand.

41
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:30,510
On the right table, we have the same formula, except the window frame is now defined between unbounded

42
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,030
proceeding and one following.

43
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,590
So now we take all those preceding the current row and one row after the current row, which you can

44
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,330
see highlighted in green.

45
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:51,150
So the sum of the population is now fifty eight million, five hundred and ten thousand.

46
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:58,730
And remember, both of the tables on the slide are partitions, and for each partition in the context

47
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,350
of each row, we are defining a window frame.

48
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,800
So as you go down through the window, frame will also move down with that row.

49
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:15,100
Now, instead of roads, we're using range in the window frame, the difference with using range is

50
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:21,520
that it considers a range of numerical values and compares them to the common value for the column that

51
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,900
has been used in the order.

52
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:30,370
Because if you do not have anything in your order, because you cannot use range, you must also only

53
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,420
have one expression in your order, because when using wrench.

54
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:42,370
So when we're using rows rather than range and we see one proceeding, for example, that means one

55
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:42,730
road.

56
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:50,870
But when we say one preceding Farangis, it means one unit of the value that's being evaluated.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,320
So if we have subregions I.D. that is being used in our order because the current row has a subregion

58
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:07,530
idea of 20, then one proceeding would mean subregion idea of 19 as 20, minus one is 19.

59
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,540
And that doesn't exist in our table.

60
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:21,570
So in the example on the left, we have our politician the same as before, and our query is ordered

61
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,730
by subregion ID.

62
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:31,840
But in the window frame, we say range 10 proceeding because remember, the preceding subregion ID value

63
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:39,640
from our current view is 20, which is 10 lower since we have subregion in the order, because this

64
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,900
is what the range considers.

65
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,150
So the current route has a subregion of 30.

66
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:52,970
And this is ordered so we can see that 10 proceeding, which is 30, minus 10 equals 20.

67
00:05:53,430 --> 00:06:01,620
So that is the range that is used in our window frame for the current row, which is all subregion yds

68
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,840
between the range 20 and 30.

69
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,660
And that is highlighted in green.

70
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:16,610
So for the current row, the sum of the population would be fifty five million, five hundred thousand.

71
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:24,430
For the right side partition, we use a range between unbounded proceeding and 10 following.

72
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:33,040
So we start right at the top and go ten following the value of the subregion ID in the current row,

73
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,690
since the subregion ID in the current row is 30.

74
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:47,680
We do 30 plus 10 equals 40, but as you can see, there are two roles which belong to Country EAF.

75
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,610
That are part of subregion 40, so they are both included.

76
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:05,600
It looks for the range of values for subregion ID to select all the rows preceding the current row.

77
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,420
Up to subregion 40.

78
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:18,930
And some of the population for the current road would be 78 million, five hundred and ten thousand.

79
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:28,470
If you have nothing specified for the window frame and if the order is specified, then the default

80
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:33,560
window frame is range between inbounded proceeding and current row.

81
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:40,100
The highlighted green shading shows you the window frame for the current road.

82
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:49,300
If you have not specified an order by and have not included a window frame in your overflows, then

83
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:56,020
the default specification is rows between unbounded proceeding and unbounded following.

84
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:04,960
The highlighted green shading is the default window frame for the current work, and that just takes

85
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,380
all values in that politician.
