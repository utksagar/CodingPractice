1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:06,800
So we've seen that if we apply the over clause with no partition, then there's some aggregation function

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,290
applies to all those in the entire table.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,480
We can specify partitions for our window functions, for example, if we want the sum returned for the

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,270
total region, for that specific role, we can state partition by region it.

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:31,200
So if the road has a region idea of 10, then we will return the total population for region wide 10.

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:41,300
So to apply an analytical function which is partitioned by region wide, I can type select name, which

7
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:47,480
is the country name population, just so I can compare the population for the country to the population,

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:54,380
for the total region wide region on underscore ID and then the actual analytical function, which is

9
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:01,580
some population, and then within the overlord's type partition by region.

10
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:06,500
Underscore right from Epper underscore countries.

11
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,290
So this returns.

12
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,850
The total population for region is 10.

13
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,560
And then if I scroll down, you can see the total population.

14
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,500
For regionality 20.

15
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,030
And so on with region 30.

16
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:45,180
So there's some aggregation function is partitioned by region, and it will calculate at a low level

17
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,920
the total population.

18
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,000
For the region, I'd of that road.

19
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,840
So in the first row, it will calculate the total population for region wide 10.

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,050
We can also partition by multiple columns.

21
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,120
Let me now partition by region and subregion.

22
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,680
And now the population is calculated for both the region and the subregion.

23
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,510
Let me make this clear by actually including the sub region, it is in the results.

24
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:36,640
So now the population four region is 10 and subregion 10 is six hundred and forty eight million.

25
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,930
And as I scroll down.

26
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,820
As soon as the subregion, it changes to 80, we've calculated the total population for region wide

27
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:59,230
10 and subregion ID 80, whereas in the previous example we calculated the entire population for region

28
00:02:59,230 --> 00:02:59,500
10.

29
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:08,080
OK, so that was a lecture on how to include politicians in your analytical functions, give it some

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,520
practice in your own time, and move on to the next lecture once you're comfortable with this.
