1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:09,750
For this scenario, we want to flag a country that is in the top 10 percentile for its region, so to

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,760
do this, we can use percent rank.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:20,970
We must order the population from highest to lowest and anything below or equal to zero point one,

4
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:27,930
which is the percent rank and is equivalent to the top 10 percentile because remember, percent rank

5
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,180
goes from zero to one.

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,290
She needs to be flagged.

7
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:40,450
So let's select a name which is the country name population, just so we have a reference of the population

8
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:47,560
for each country and then apply percent rank, we don't need to specify anything in the parameter,

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,170
four percent rank and in the over clause.

10
00:00:50,350 --> 00:01:00,070
We must partition by region idea and order by population dissenting because we want from highest to

11
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,540
lowest for each partition.

12
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:14,350
And I'll select from Evea undisclosed countries now we have not finished the query, but I just want

13
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,320
to see what this looks like so far.

14
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:27,750
So now let me actually add regionality for clarity as well so we can see the partitions.

15
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:41,400
So for regionality 10, we can see that the partition we would like is up to Canada because after that

16
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,350
we get above zero point one.

17
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,030
So the top ten percentile countries in region 10 from the USA.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,870
Up to Canada.

19
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:59,020
So we need to flag these as, let's say one and the rest is zero and the same as we go to the next partition

20
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,220
of 20.

21
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,790
This time we have the Russian Federation, Germany, UK, all the way up to Spain, which we'd like

22
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,390
to include.

23
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:16,170
So to do this, we can use a case statement that will keep this analytical function here just for reference,

24
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,610
and I'll copy it.

25
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,630
So I'll type case when.

26
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:32,930
And my condition, and I would like this less than or equal to zero point one dinoflagellates, one

27
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,620
else zero, and I'll end as top 10.

28
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,940
Acento.

29
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,670
You, Ron.

30
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:54,950
Now we have a flag for the top 10 percentile countries partitioned by each region.
