1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:11,010
So to do this, we can use the two to function on the order date, time field, so let's just select

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,940
start from the orders first.

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,330
So as I was saying, we could use that to try to function on the order date time field to just extract

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,640
the month and the year.

5
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,770
So let me show you.

6
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:44,870
As you can see now, if you're not familiar with the two child function, I suggest you refer to the

7
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:51,530
documentation online and I've also covered it in my previous course, the comprehensive Esquibel course.

8
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:59,510
OK, so from our query, we can select voter ID.

9
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,280
To try to take time

10
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,220
out Ailey's this as a month.

11
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,900
Yeah, and I'd also like to order Total.

12
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:30,160
And to find the difference, I'd like to order total subtracted by the analytical function, utilizing

13
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,560
Max on the order total.

14
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,990
And I'd like that over the partition.

15
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,160
By the month and year combination.

16
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,150
Now, remember, I can't use the alias of Monsignor.

17
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,880
Because the select statement is executed after the window function.

18
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:10,940
Refer to the query order of execution if you're unfamiliar with this, so now I'll aliased this as diff

19
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:19,440
from Max from the underscore orders and here.

20
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:30,710
So now for the month of January 2021, we can see that the order total in the current row of one hundred

21
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,670
one point seven.

22
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,690
Is two hundred and ninety eight point thirty three less than the maximum order total?

23
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,450
And if I scroll down.

24
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,860
While we're still in the position of January twenty one.

25
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,060
We can see that here the variance is zero.

26
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,970
So four hundred point zero three is our maximum order total.

27
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,660
And as we get to the next partition.

28
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:12,560
Which is February twenty one, again, we can see that on maximum order total is five one seven point

29
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,680
six nine, and that is where the variance is taken from.
