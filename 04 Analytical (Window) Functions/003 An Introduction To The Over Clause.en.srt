00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:07,650
The Overlords is what determines the partitioning and ordering of the Rousset before the window function

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,880
itself is a polite.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,390
As you've seen in this context, within the over clause, you can specify the partition, the ordering

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,770
and the window frame itself.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,860
If you do not specify any partition, then the over clause applies to the entire table.

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:24,780
Let me show you.

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:36,720
Let's use the over clause with some aggregation on populations in the countries table so we can type

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:47,940
select name, comma, some population and then just specify over with no partitioning, ordering or

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,970
window frames in parentheses and then from every underscore countries.

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:06,990
So as you can see, we return seven point seven billion, this is the sum of the population for the

11
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,070
entire table.

12
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:15,580
Because we haven't specified any partition or window frame, the function has summed all rose in the

13
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:22,060
table if I just select some population to confirm this.

14
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,360
You can see that the some of the population is the same.

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,920
I will cover the partition by close order, by close and window frames in the next lecture's.

16
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,280
But as you've seen, if you just use the overgrowth on its own, it applies the window function to every

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,660
row in the query table.

18
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,170
This is also an alternative to applying an aggregation without using the group because.
