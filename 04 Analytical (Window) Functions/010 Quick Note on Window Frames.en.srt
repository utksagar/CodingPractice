00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,930
I wanted to show a quick one analytical functions when using single bounce, specifically the following

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,820
single bound in your window frame.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:17,290
As you know, Rose, and proceeding is the same as saying rose between and proceeding and current work.

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,380
Let me show you some iSelect name.

5
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,150
Population.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,120
For that region Heidi and sub region, Heidi.

7
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:48,570
And now that an analytical function where I am partitioning by region wide and subregional

8
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,110
ordering by sub region it.

9
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,820
And for the window frame, I'll specify rose to preceding.

10
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,340
And now occupy this.

11
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:24,670
And I will change the window frame to rose between two proceeding and current row from undisclosed countries.

12
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,890
So these two should be exactly the same because those two proceeding should be the same, the same rows

13
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,900
between two proceeding and current.

14
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,520
And as you can see.

15
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,950
If you compare the two numbers.

16
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,870
There will be exactly the same.

17
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,170
Even as we get to the next partition, surely.

18
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,650
And here we go.

19
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:01,260
So, as I said, Rose to proceeding is the same as rose between two proceeding and current road rules

20
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:07,120
and following means the same thing as rose between current rule and following.

21
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:13,380
But when we use the following as a single bound, for some reason the query fails.

22
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,060
Let me show you.

23
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,810
So I will comment this out.

24
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,840
And I will change proceeding to following.

25
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:26,950
Were.

26
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,210
Missing keyword now if I change this to preceding.

27
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:44,060
The query works, so if you need an following, then a workaround would be to take.

28
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,200
Between.

29
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:57,220
Current road and to following, and if I come to south.

30
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,950
You can see that works and we already know.

31
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:11,960
That between current and following should be the same as to follow me, so I just wanted to flag that

32
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,360
as a bit of a quirk to look out for.
