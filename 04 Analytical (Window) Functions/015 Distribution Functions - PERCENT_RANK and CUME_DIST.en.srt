1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:10,200
The distribution functions I want to talk about our present rank and Kim percent rank is the percentile

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,940
ranking of the number of a road between zero and one.

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:23,660
The formula is rank minus one, divided by the total number of rows, minus one.

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,360
And this is applied to each partition.

5
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:39,230
Kim, this is the cumulative distribution value within a group of values is the number of rose less

6
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:45,890
than or equal to the value of the current row, divided by the total number of rows.

7
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,860
And again, the value is between zero and one and applied to each partition.

8
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:00,140
To get the desired result, four percent rank and cume dysfunctions, you need to apply the order by

9
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,090
because inside the over clause for that field that you would like evaluated.

10
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:13,060
If you're using our escarole, the autobiographers is mandatory and the omission of an order by clause

11
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,880
will result in the query failure.

12
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,880
And again, another on another database management systems, the query remains to execute, but it will

13
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:29,110
not return any meaningful results because your data really needs to be ranked in order for this for

14
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,000
these functions to be meaningful.

15
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:39,940
OK, so let's apply the two distribution functions to the countries table and order it by population.

16
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:58,040
So we select name population percent rank over quarter by population.

17
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,260
And since we're ordering like population, that is what the percent rank function will evaluate, so

18
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:11,050
we will evaluate the population field and the same will go for the cume just function.

19
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,700
From EPA and school countries.

20
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,620
And here on.

21
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,750
Here are our results.

22
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,090
If I go right to the end.

23
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:42,430
Both the percent rank and the cume dysfunctions return one, which makes sense because the range is

24
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,720
between zero and one.

25
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,940
So now let's apply a partition by regionality.

26
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,740
Christianised it.

27
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:18,440
So the same scenario applies, except for the functions are applied to each participant, as you can

28
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,180
see, for the end of the partition for region and 10.

29
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:30,830
Both functions return one and then they start again at the next partition and again if I remove the

30
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,670
order by close.

31
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,200
We return an error.
