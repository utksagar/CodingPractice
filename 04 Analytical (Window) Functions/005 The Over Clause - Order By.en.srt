1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,690
The order by crews is used to order the rows and each partition.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,690
You can order by more than one column.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:18,580
So let's use an analytical function to some the population and order it by region into ascending.

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,500
So let's select a name which is a country name population.

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,270
Regionality.

6
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,460
And then the analytical function.

7
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:48,610
So while some population just correct that over and I'll specify order by region is ascending and ascending

8
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,520
is the default.

9
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:58,140
So even if I wasn't to specify anything, it would be ordered in ascending order from evah underscore

10
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,110
countries.

11
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:01,620
Right.

12
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:13,970
So as you can see, the results are ordered by region wide and here, as you can see, the total population

13
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,210
is still the same.

14
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,890
And since we haven't applied a partition, the order by clause in the over clause applies to the entire

15
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,460
table and it's ordered by region from low.

16
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:28,710
Ty.

17
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:37,010
OK, so now let's order by region and subregion ID

18
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,370
and Allied Subregion ID as a column.

19
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,120
And I'll execute.

20
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,020
So now we have the table.

21
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,030
Ordered by region and subregion, it from Lord.

22
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,660
Ty.

23
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,790
If I was to now specify a politician.

24
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:26,940
By region, underscore I.D. and order by sub region ID and I'll specify descending for this time from

25
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,570
high to low.

26
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,560
You can see now each individual partition, which is region 10.

27
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,400
So the population has now been calculated for region wide 10, but it's also ordered by subregion ID

28
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,110
descending.

29
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,870
So it goes from eight to 10 and then we'll move on to the next partition of twenty.

30
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,240
And then we have a new value in the road for 20 and they were range from high.

31
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:55,720
Tylo.
