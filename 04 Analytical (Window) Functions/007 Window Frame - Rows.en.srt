1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,100
Now, let's start with some examples by defining which rose to use in window frame.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:16,290
I'm using the country's tables, too, and I want to partition by regionality and subregion it and also

3
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,070
order it by subregions it.

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,280
So let's start by using Rose unbounded proceeding and unbounded following.

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:37,770
So I'll select a name which is a country name, regionality sub region IT population.

6
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:51,610
And now I would define my analytical function, which I will be the sum of the population over partition

7
00:00:52,300 --> 00:01:05,530
by region and the security and sub region and the security, I also order the partition by sub region

8
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,010
it.

9
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,020
And now to define my window frame, I'll type Rose Inbounded.

10
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:30,170
Proceeding and inbounded following, and I'll name that as a from EPA undisclosed countries.

11
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,150
Now let's hear from.

12
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,310
Got the between keyword.

13
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:55,970
So if we look at problem A, we can see that we've defined each partition as a combination of the region

14
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,550
and the sub region, it.

15
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,670
So for some reason, it 10 and regionality 10.

16
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:09,650
We have the total population, which I think is six hundred and forty eight million.

17
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,200
When we scroll down.

18
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,560
And we get to subregion it.

19
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,750
Of 80.

20
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:27,850
We recalculate the total population for region wide 10 and sub region 80, which is three hundred and

21
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,250
sixty seven million approximately.

22
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,550
And this is because we've defined unbounded proceeding and unbounded following as the window frame.

23
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,810
So for each row.

24
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:48,650
For that specific politician, which in our case, the politician is defined by each distinct regional

25
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:55,780
and subregional combination, the some formula will take all roles for each politician.

26
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,830
Now, let's do another analytical function.

27
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,700
Using the same.

28
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,740
Partitioned by an order by criteria.

29
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:24,660
So I'll just copy and paste it, and this time I'll define the partition as one proceeding and one follow

30
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:35,070
me, so I'll type rose, one rose between the other, between Keywood, one proceeding and one following,

31
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,200
and I'll call that as B I let it run.

32
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,710
Now, let's see what's happening here.

33
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,230
So for Colombe, each window frame again.

34
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,330
Is defined within the partition of region wide and subregion.

35
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:03,100
I did so for column B again, we're using the partition of regionality and subregion.

36
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,490
But for the window frame, we're defining one proceeding and one following in the context of the current

37
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:09,760
row.

38
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,630
So for Jamaica.

39
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,660
Nothing is proceeding in.

40
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,750
But we have the population of Honduras following it.

41
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,650
So we take.

42
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:34,550
Two million, nine hundred and forty thousand and add that to the population of Honduras, which is

43
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:40,790
approximately nine point seven million, and we get our result here, which is the sum of these two

44
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,630
populations.

45
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,970
And then when we get to our next route, which is Honduras, this time for the window frame, we have

46
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,310
one proceeding, we have the current route and we have one following.

47
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,920
So this value.

48
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:08,330
Of one hundred and forty million is the sum of the population of Mexico, Honduras and Jamaica, and

49
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,230
we continue doing that until we get to the end of the partition.

50
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,890
Which is Grenada.

51
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:27,010
And this value of four hundred and two thousand eight hundred and thirty five would be the sum of French

52
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:32,620
Guiana plus Granada, because remember we're at the end of the partition.

53
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:38,680
So the following value of Canada is actually part of a different partition because the subregion, it

54
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,330
is 80.

55
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,250
So we just take the sum of this valley and this value.

56
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:51,310
And again, when we start with Canada, which is at the new partition, this valley would be the sum

57
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:56,280
of the current group and one following because remember, there is nothing preceding this partition.

58
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:05,620
So let's do one more example just to cement our understanding and this time all the current road and

59
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,490
to follow.

60
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,710
So I'll just.

61
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,680
Copy this and modify it, palitha ac.

62
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:23,180
Rows between current row and two following.

63
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,450
And here, Ron.

64
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:36,770
So now for each politician, we take the value of the current population, which will be Tumaco in this

65
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:42,290
current group, which would be the top rate, and then at the population of Honduras and Mexico to get

66
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,120
the value of one hundred and forty million.

67
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:53,510
So it's essentially just an offset of B by one word, and remember, just as with Colombe, each politician

68
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,050
changes.

69
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,160
With the next subregion, it.
