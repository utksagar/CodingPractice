00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:07,800
You'll already be familiar with the escarole query order of execution, as you know, the from clause

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,860
is evaluated first, followed by any table joins and then Rollerball facilities such as the where clause.

00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,610
You then have your group by Claus's and having close.

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:26,570
Window functions are evaluated after the having close, but before the select statement.

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:33,460
So that's just something to keep in mind in terms of where the window functions, a.k.a. analytical

6
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,410
