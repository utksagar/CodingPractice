1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,870
OK, so for this scenario, what we'd like to do is find the difference between the country's population

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:15,270
in the current Roe vs. the population of the country with the highest population in the entire table.

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,570
So to do that, we take select name population.

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,860
And then use the emacs function.

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,350
On the population field over.

6
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:37,480
And we can just leave this blank because we'd like to find the max population for the entire table.

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,680
From EPA and school countries now, we still need to calculate the variance, but if I execute this

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,700
query, I just want to see what it looks like.

9
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,430
So we have a maximum population here, which is one point four billion, and I believe that's China.

10
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,910
And then we have the population for the country in the current rate.

11
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,900
So we just need to do this.

12
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,420
Were subtracted by this very.

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,030
To find the difference between the current country's population and the population of the country with

14
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:21,980
the maximal population, so that which is the population minus and I can just copy this analytical function

15
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:28,160
and that as diff from Max.

16
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:38,740
And you can see the population of Ireland is quite a lot lower than the population of China.
