Unlike aggregate functions, however, Analytic Functions can return multiple rows for each group. We can use Analytic Functions to compute aggregated values, moving averages, running totals, percentages or top-N results within a group and much, much more as you will see in this section.</p><p>We will cover in detail the syntax for Analytical Functions and have a series of code alongs, practice scenarios and assignment questions.</p><p>By the end of this section you will have a solid understanding of Analytical Functions.</p></p>
