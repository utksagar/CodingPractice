1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:07,820
OK, so for this question, we actually need to reverse the direction and go up from Smith all the way

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:13,130
to King so we can do that by swapping the employee and manager in the connect by close.

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,560
And we need the manager to be the child and the employee to be the parent column.

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,790
So that's type select start from and start with.

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,790
Employer equals seven three six nine.

6
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:39,910
Which is Smith's employee number, and then we connect by prior to this time specified manager equals

7
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:40,330
employee.

8
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,820
So now we actually go from Smith has the root to food, Jones and King.

9
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,230
And he is treated as the parent node.

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,920
As a result, we can see all the people that he reports in to and who they in turn report into uptaking.

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,820
Who is the president?
