1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:06,190
So this question is a bit trickier and actually involves using some queries.

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:15,860
So let's do this in part first, let's use the hierarchical query to have Jones as the root, so I'll

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,930
select all films from the MPT.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,860
Start with Jones Employee ID.

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,690
And then connect by Priya and his manager.

6
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:43,340
OK, so now we have all employees who directly report to Jones or indirectly report into Jones.

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,550
So and Ford directly reporting to Jones.

8
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,250
Adams reports to Scott and Smith reports to Ford, so they both indirectly report to Jones.

9
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:06,740
So now we just need to sum all of these salaries, excluding Jones, so let's use a workload's where

10
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,030
Mpondo.

11
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,180
Does not equal seven, five, six, six.

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:25,920
And now we just need to sign this so we can actually use this as a subquery sign close in parenthesis,

13
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,220
open, close and then just hide.

14
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:41,780
Select some sound from.

15
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,700
And are.

16
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,120
And the answer is seven thousand nine hundred.

17
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:55,900
You know, if you found another way to get to the same answer using hierarchical queries, then that's

18
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,410
also fine.
