1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:07,080
Connect Beirut can be used in the select statement to return the root value in each word, you just

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,930
specify the column of the record to return.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,500
Connect Beirut is used in the select statement.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,120
The syntax is to type connect Beirut and then the name of the column to return from the root record.

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,060
So if I query the table with King as the root and using the connect by clause as follows.

6
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,590
You can see that King is the route and he's on the top.

7
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:09,030
So if I then type followed by Connect by route and the name calling.

8
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:20,520
We now have King repeated in each row, and we can also alias this caller.

9
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,190
As you can see.

10
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:41,250
Now, let's do the same, but this time with Jones as the root, so where employee start with employees

11
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,120
equals seven, five, six, six.

12
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,490
Now we have Jones.

13
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,070
And if I don't want to return the name, I can just type another column.

14
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,930
So let's say emperor.

15
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:12,620
And instead of the name, we return the employee ID now let's see what happens when we don't have to

16
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,520
start with field.

17
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,440
So we're using multiple routes.

18
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,720
So if I delete this Antikythera.

19
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,800
So now we can see.

20
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,690
The employee number that each role belongs to.

21
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,890
And that makes it much clearer to understand who the root is, and it will become even clearer if I

22
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,260
change this to you name again.

23
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:51,070
So now we can see all the records where Scott is, the route forward, Allen James and so on.

24
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:04,160
This connect bypass function shows you the path up to the route for each node, you just define a separator

25
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,110
and just like the connect by path and level, it's used in the select statement.

26
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:20,620
And the function takes two parameters, the column name and the separator, which is a character.

27
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:31,900
So let's use this connect bypass in our previous query with Jones as the root, so I will type, select

28
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:45,450
and dot star system to connect dots, um, underscore sorry I on this call path and I will type e name

29
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,730
and specify the dash as the separator.

30
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:52,680
From.

31
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:00,870
And I would like it to start with no equals seven, five, six, six.

32
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:12,770
Connect high pressure, temperature equals manager and hit run.

33
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:24,440
So now in our results, we can see the path, we can make this clearer by also showing level.

34
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:34,260
We can see that level one just has one employee and level two has two employees.

35
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,320
Let's go to Jones now.

36
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,480
Let's do this by commenting out.

37
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,110
Start with.

38
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:58,420
And we can see that level one just has one again, level two as two and so on, and we can also change

39
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,830
this instead of each name to the emperor and change the dash.

40
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,490
To be a forward slash.

41
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:17,060
As you can see, OK, great, so that was showing you how to use, connect, bypass and connect by.
