1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:07,750
You can filter your records using the workload's, so let us query the table with King as the root

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:16,780
and I'll actually address this at that level.

3
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,080
And that is King's employee ID.

4
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,920
OK, so let's say I do not want to return Blake.

5
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:55,660
I can just use a workload's before they start with claws and type with Infinera does not equal.

6
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,160
Seven, six, nine, eight, which is Blake's employee number.

7
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:10,930
And as you can see, Blake is no longer returned, but we do have Blake's direct reports.

8
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:18,400
If we want to exclude Blake's direct and indirect reports to, then instead of using the word close,

9
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:27,130
we can just add the clause to the connect by clause and type where and no does not equal.

10
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,340
Seven, six, nine, eight.

11
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,620
And now when I hit run.

12
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:40,350
Not only do we not return blank, but we also do not return his direct or indirect reports.

13
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,910
So that would also be the people who report into the people that report into black.

14
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:54,320
So, as you can see, specifying your condition in the connect by clause will mean that the exclusion

15
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,890
or the condition applies to the children to.
