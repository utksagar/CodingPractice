00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:08,260
You can format your results so that they're more readable using the L pad function, the Árpád function

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,010
pad the string with another string up to a certain length.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,440
It takes three parameters, the so string, which should be a column.

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,340
The total length of the string should be and the padding character.

5
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:29,650
So if your string has a length of five but only four characters, then the remaining character will

6
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,580
be padded by one additional part character on the left side.

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:47,130
So let's first query your results with King as the root, so I'll select NPR top staff level from AMP.

8
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,610
Start with AMP no equals.

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,410
Seven, eight, three, nine.

10
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:06,810
Connected by prior employer, he was manager and run.

11
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,330
OK, so it's hard to tell here where each parent is looking.

12
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:29,630
Now, if I use L pad, L pad and I will specified in.

13
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,490
Has the string.

14
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:42,640
Followed by the length, which will be the length function to the evening, plus the additional padding

15
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,210
character, which I'll just have as level, so it will be padded by one additional character if the

16
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:57,190
level is one two, if the level is two and so on, and the padding character will be the greatest and

17
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,640
simple.

18
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:06,850
And I'll use this as your name again, your name on the school had.

19
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,140
And hit, run.

20
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,130
Now we can see.

21
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:22,810
King is the top, and he has one character below him, we have Jones and then Jones, whose quotes got

22
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,810
reporting into him, and then Scott has Adams reporting into him.

23
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,070
So it's clear to see now the structure.

24
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:37,270
So that's just a quick tip on formatting your results to make your hierarchy a little bit more readable.
