1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:09,580
If we use the order by close, then we break the hierarchical ordering of the data using order by siblings

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:15,850
preserves the hierarchy primarily and then orders the results by the specified columns.

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:25,180
The order by siblings clause can only be used in hierarchical queries, so if I query the table with

4
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,990
Blake as the root and using the connect by clause as follows.

5
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:41,990
Start with M equals seven.

6
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:54,720
Six, nine, eight, four black connect by prior and equals manager and her.

7
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,400
So here we have Blakers, our route.

8
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,380
And all of his reports.

9
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,710
So now let's use the order by close.

10
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:16,250
An order based on your name ascending and its default by ascending to I don't need to write it.

11
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,970
Now, as you can see, we've actually broken the hierarchy, Blake is no longer at the top.

12
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,210
So let's use order siblings by instead.

13
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,400
Now, as you can see, we retain the hierarchy, but now the siblings.

14
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,570
In level two are arranged in alphabetical order, AJ MTW.

15
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:52,010
So that's just a short lecture showing you how to order your results, but retain the hierarchy primarily.
