00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,720
I recall Escudo has hierarchical queries that are used specifically for data that is hierarchical,

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:13,100
these queries allow you to arrange the rows of these tables in hierarchical order.

3
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,880
Hierarchical data is data that contains a parent child relationship.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:28,120
For example, organizational data such as the empty pool that we query, there are two fields the employee

5
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,410
and the manager field.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,420
The manager field is the parent column and the employee field is the child column.

7
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:42,280
Other examples of hierarchical data include general ledger data, for example, you have costs that

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,070
belong to specific subaccount codes and these subaccount codes roll up into account codes.

9
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,430
You also have product hierarchies where you have some products and product categories.

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,440
There are many other hierarchical data set examples, too, but for this section will specifically be

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,990
working on our table.

12
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:12,110
This slide shows our table data arranged in its tree structure so you can see the hierarchy.

13
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,040
Right at the top is King, who is the president.

14
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,840
He does not have a manager and below King we have Jones Lake and Clark.

15
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:27,730
This is the next level down and is referred to as level two in the hierarchy.

16
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:38,710
Jones has two reports, Scott and Forward Blake has five reports, Alan Ward, Martin Turner and James

17
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,910
and Clark has one report.

18
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,380
Miller, this is referred to as level three.

19
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:52,940
Then in the next level, we have Adams, who reports to Scott and Smith, who reports to Ford, this

20
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,560
is referred to as level four.

21
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:04,250
All of the so-called employees can be referred to as parents or roots as they have employees who reporting

22
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:04,730
into them.

23
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,900
So this is our hierarchy now when we look at the table in Oracle, it's not so clear compared to this

24
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,440
diagram.

25
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:21,320
This is because the data is not arranged in hierarchical order, and that's why we use hierarchical

26
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,650
queries, as you will see in the coming lectures.

27
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,100
The syntax for hierarchical queries is shown on the screen, and the bits highlighted in orange are

28
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,920
y will go through in turn in the coming lectures.

29
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,650
So for now, just keep this as a reference and I will explain all of the pseudo columns, functions

30
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,580
and clauses.
