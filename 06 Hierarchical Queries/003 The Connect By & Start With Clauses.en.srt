1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:07,780
The connect by prior clause defines the parent and child columns in your table, the column immediately

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,560
following the prior keyword is the child column.

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,480
OK, so let's see some examples of this.

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,940
I'm going to select all columns from the table.

5
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,770
Now, I want to use the Kinect because.

6
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:36,530
And have no problem as the child him and the manager column has the parent column to do that.

7
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:47,180
I totally connect by prior and immediately following the prior Keywood I typed in because that's the

8
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,610
child column equals manager.

9
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:57,500
So here is where we are defining our parent child relationship with the child and manager as the parent.

10
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,050
And yet.

11
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,760
Before I do, I'm going to increase the limit.

12
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,020
OK, so from our results.

13
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,810
We could see that we've returned thirty nine rows, our dataset only has 14.

14
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,490
So the reason for this is because if we do not specify the start with close and I will explain the start

15
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:35,790
with close, surely then we return the result for each route slash parent.

16
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:46,650
So let me show you, you recall that the first result in our record is Scott empaneling seven, seven,

17
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,840
eight, eight, and he has one report, Adams.

18
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,840
Both of them report into joint.

19
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:04,870
Ford, which is the third row, also has one report, Smith and both of them also report into Jones.

20
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,170
So this the first four rows.

21
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,630
Actually use Jones as the root.

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,560
And then from the fifth through, we have Alan, James, Turner, Martin and Ward.

23
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,870
They will report into Blake.

24
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,950
This continues until every parent has been evaluated.

25
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,040
So essentially, this is iterating with each parent as the root.

26
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:47,110
So let's say I want to see the results only with Jones as the root.

27
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:55,600
Well, I can type start with before the connect by clause to start with clause specifies which routes

28
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,350
to include.

29
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,750
So if I want to include Jones, I can type.

30
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:14,020
Before the connect by clothes start with empire equals seven, five, six, six.

31
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,190
And now here we have Jones with all of his direct and indirect reports.

32
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,200
Now, what if we wanted to see King, who's the president, as the root?

33
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,320
Well, we can change the empire to be King's empire, which is seven, eight, three nine.

34
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:49,740
And now we have all 14 crews, because everyone reports indicate you'll note that Kim does not have

35
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,560
a manager, right.

36
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,560
So we could also specify talk with manager is No.

37
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,890
And we would get the same results.

38
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:11,390
And note that whatever column immediately follows the prior Keywood is referred to as the child column.

39
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,530
So if I swapped the prior to be on the other side.

40
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:30,630
Then the manager field is deemed to be the child column and the field is the parent, so we're now actually

41
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,730
changing the direction of the tree.

42
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,910
So let's check the result.

43
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:46,430
As you can see, we only return one result this time, and that is because if we change the direction

44
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,950
of the tree, there is nobody above.

45
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,760
So let's test this for James.

46
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,680
So Jones has an inferno of seven, five, six, six.

47
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,490
Now we can see everybody above Jones, which is just king.

48
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,590
And now if I swapped the premier over again.

49
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:30,050
We can see everyone below Jones and I can also swap around manager, and I'm not here to reverse the

50
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,000
direction as well.

51
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,570
So remember to type prior before you input your child in the equation.
