1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:06,610
Level is a pseudo problem that can be used in the select statement only when iConnect connect by clause

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,900
is used and shows the level in the hierarchy for each record.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,360
Previously in the tree structure, I showed you the four levels of the hierarchy.

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:26,700
So if I query the map table with King as the route and using the connect by clause as follows.

5
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,320
It's not so clear to see the level for each record belongs to in the hierarchy.

6
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,060
So if you want the level, you can just type.

7
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,460
After qualifying this asterisk.

8
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:04,910
Level.

9
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,200
And now we can see the full.

10
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,410
Levels one, two, three, four, four, the hierarchy, so it's clear to see.

11
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,800
That he is Blake.

12
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,310
And here are all of his reports as the one level below.

13
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,410
So level one.

14
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,280
Has leveled to reporting into it.

15
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,270
Jones.

16
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:34,810
Clark.

17
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,180
And I missed Flakier.

18
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:47,030
And then level two has level three reporting it into it, and then level three has level for reporting

19
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,470
into it.

20
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:56,490
So let's do this again now, this time with Blakers, the route with no equals.

21
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,770
Seven, six, nine, eight.

22
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,490
So whoever the root is will be level one.

23
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,430
And as we can see, Blake is level one and he has five reports, high level to.

24
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:22,540
So let's do it now for Jones, and you'll recall that he has two reports and his reports have reports,

25
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,670
so we expect three levels.

26
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,470
Jones has an emperor of seven, five, six, six.

27
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:43,580
And as you can see, we get three levels, so level is a really useful pseudo problem to show you the

28
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,550
level that each record belongs to.

29
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:53,140
And note once again that it can only be used when the connect by clause has been used.
