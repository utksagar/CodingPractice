1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:07,220
Roll-Up is an extension to the group bylaws that allows you to generate subtotal as well as mine totals.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,400
The subtitles are generated based on the order of the columns provided after the Roll-Up Keywood, the

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,460
first column provided is on the top of the hierarchy and the last column provided is at the bottom of

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,120
the hierarchy.

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,760
So in the syntax on the screen, we have to non-segregated columns in our select statement, column

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:35,480
one and column two in our group because we have the Roll-Up extension with column one and column two

7
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,620
in parenthesis.

8
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,770
Column one is first.

9
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,750
So that is greater than column two in terms of its hierarchy.

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:49,070
So when the subtitles are generated, they are done first for the column one column two combination

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,420
and then it's done for the column one combination on its own.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,960
And then finally it's done for the grand total.

13
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:04,530
In the next example, we have three columns in the roll up extension column.

14
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:10,190
One is greater than column two and column two is greater than column three in terms of its hierarchy.

15
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:16,010
And this is based on the ordering column one is first column to a second and column three third.

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,240
So that's also the order of the hierarchy.

17
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:27,050
So when the subtotal is generated first, they are generated for column one, two and three and then

18
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:32,960
they are generated for column one and column two combination and then calculated for the column one

19
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,650
on its own.

20
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,740
And then the grand total is calculated.

21
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:44,850
OK, so let's do an example, using our eBay underscore countries table, I first want to do a group

22
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,020
buy and return the total population grouped by region and subregion.

23
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,740
I note that I will use the Engvall function to replace null values for the region.

24
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:03,150
Idee and subregion ID columns to replace nulls with zero as nodes can be confusing to interpret when

25
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,400
analysing our results.

26
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:12,860
So I type select and then I specify Engvall region underscore.

27
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:27,940
And zero zero is the value to replace and he knows that Engvall sub region and then the aggregation,

28
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,030
which will be the sum of the population.

29
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:45,040
From India on the scale countries, and I want to groove by these two points and note, I am retaining

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,830
the enviable evening in the group columns and here by.

31
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,540
Here are our results.

32
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,400
No, we don't have any.

33
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:07,400
Subtotal or grand hotels, apart from obviously the totals of the region, idee and subregion it grew

34
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:07,700
by.

35
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:15,810
So now let's use the Roll-Up in our group by clause, so I will.

36
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,640
Type Roll-Up.

37
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:29,530
Open parenthesis, put this in a single line for readability, close parentheses and terminate with

38
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,280
a semicolon.

39
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,170
And here, run.

40
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:45,050
So before I even evaluate the results, I'll tell you what I expect to see, I would expect to see some

41
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:52,210
totals for the region and the subregions combination, which would also be returned by the normal group,

42
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,230
by Claw's anyway.

43
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,440
So no change there.

44
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,820
But then I would also expect to see the region totals as the subregion.

45
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,000
It would get dropped off and then I would expect to see the grand total.

46
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,000
So as you can see.

47
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:17,750
All of these rows here are the combinations for regionality and subregion anyway, and then where we've

48
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:25,280
got a nul in the subregion, it signifies that we've got a total value for regionality.

49
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:31,790
So you can see that the value for regionality 10 is just over a billion, and that would be the sum

50
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,230
of these two values here.

51
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,340
And if we keep scrolling down.

52
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,400
Where we've got to null values would be the grand total.

53
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,640
So that would be seven point seven billion.

54
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,050
OK, great.

55
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:58,960
So next, let's do a roll up with three columns, let's add organization regionality.

56
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:05,440
So I will type Engvall organization region wide.

57
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:14,970
Papilla, don't forget to do a comma before and then add that to the hierarchy.

58
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:26,210
And he and actually, before I hit run this time, what I expect to see would be the subtitles for the

59
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:32,660
region in the subregion was an organization regionality, as you would even if this was a group by statement.

60
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,640
Then I would expect to see the subtotal for the region and the subregion I'd combination and then just

61
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,310
for the region it and then the grand total, so let's it run.

62
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,970
So as you can see.

63
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:01,040
Each row individually is showing the combination of all three columns, and then we have the total for

64
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,250
the region and the sub region and combinations where we have no value in the third column.

65
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:17,170
And then where we have another value in the subregion, it and the organization region IT fields would

66
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,090
be the total for the region.

67
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,280
So this is the total for region wide 10, which is, again, just over one billion.

68
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,880
And then if I keep scrolling down.

69
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,510
We have the grand total where all columns are No.

70
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:46,100
You also don't need to include all columns in your roll up, you can do a partial roll up, but of course

71
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:52,240
you do need to have all non-segregated columns from your select statement in the group by at least,

72
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,380
otherwise you'll get an error.

73
00:06:54,410 --> 00:07:03,080
So let's remove organization regionalised from the Roll-Up extension and just put it as a group by.

74
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:14,920
So this is known as a partial Roll-Up and the grouping for region, subregion, ID and organization

75
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:21,340
region ID will still happen, but then the Roll-Up will happen for the region and the subregion.

76
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,620
It.

77
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:30,060
First, it will evaluate the subtotal for the region and the sub region, it along with the organization

78
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,720
Region Idee.

79
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:39,080
Then it will calculate the subtotal for the region, it along with the organization region, and then

80
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:45,880
it will calculate the subtotal for organization region on its own because that is outside the ruler.

81
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,250
So it will always be in a subtotal combination.

82
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,690
And as you can see, we return combinations of all three.

83
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,990
And then the combination of the region and the organization region in.

84
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:13,120
And then the total for the organization region it only and we don't return the grand total because no

85
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,760
matter what happens, we must group by organization regionality, which is outside of the Roll-Up.

86
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,730
Now, if I was to remove the organization regionality altogether.

87
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,970
I would get an error.

88
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,120
Because we still need to group this non-segregated field.

89
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:41,310
OK, so these examples are just to show you the different ways that you can leverage the role up extension

90
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,570
in your group because.
