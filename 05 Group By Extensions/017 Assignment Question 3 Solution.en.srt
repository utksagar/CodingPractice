1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,660
OK, so for this example, we can use grouping sets as we have a specified grouping requirement.

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:14,960
And we must also use Engvall to replace Norns with zero when it comes to the region and subregion,

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,680
it feels.

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:25,430
So we type, select and deal for region wide zero.

5
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:39,900
And the sub region wide zero and the organization reaching 80 zero.

6
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,160
And then the aggregation, which is some of the population.

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,530
From the debate from the school countries, and then we regrouped by.

8
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:06,800
Grouping sets open parenthesis, and now I'll leave some gaps here so that I can ensure that I've put

9
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,460
this in properly and for the first grouping, I would like regionality and organization regionality.

10
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,790
So I'll just copy all of this in here and I'll format it inside the parentheses.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,510
Get rid of subregions it.

12
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,930
So here's the first grouping.

13
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,520
I'll put that in the same line and I'll give it its own parenthesis.

14
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,590
Close parenthesis here for the next grouping.

15
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,520
I would like subregion ID, an organization, region ID.

16
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,290
How is that?

17
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,090
Get rid of the comma and then terminate with a semicolon.

18
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,090
So here is our greeting sets.

19
00:01:52,990 --> 00:02:00,430
We've got regionality and organization REGENHARD and then we've got subregion ID and organization regionality.

20
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:06,760
And remember to use Northville even in the group clothes and run.

21
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,900
OK, so we can now see the total.

22
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,610
For the region and the region, it as well as.

23
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,820
The subregion ID and the old regionality.
