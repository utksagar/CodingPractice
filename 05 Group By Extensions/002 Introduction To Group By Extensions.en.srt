1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:07,690
When performing a normal group, you return the summary rose based on the group columns, but you do

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:13,780
not return any subtotal or grand totals, as you can see on the example table, on the slide.

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,790
Using Tube Roll-Up and grouping sets, which are known as extensions to the group by Bangalore's, can

4
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,230
allow you to obtain subtitles and grand totals in your group by results.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,570
And you can see this on the right side table.

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,820
We now have two rows which contain the subtitles based on the location it.

7
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:46,120
So the total for location one is two hundred thousand and location two is one hundred thousand.

8
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,640
We also return a grand total, which is three hundred thousand.

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,040
So in the course of the next few lectures, I will talk about the various extensions to the group by

10
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,410
clause so that you can return subtitles and grandnephew tools in your group by queries.
