1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:06,930
OK, so for this question, we just need to group by subregion and óg regionality.

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:15,290
We need a Roll-Up extension and to provide subregion as the top level hierarchy and then all Guijin

3
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:22,160
after this way, it will evaluate the subregion and all region total as per the usual group gloopy,

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,730
and then the subregion indeed as the top hierarchy.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,940
And then it will also calculate the grand total.

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,820
Another requirement was to not have any null values, so we will use NPL with our subregion and ÓG region,

7
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:44,640
it fields in both the select statement and the by extension clauses and populate nulls with zero.

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:01:01,100
So for our solution, we type select the sub region idee zero and organization region wide.

9
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,290
Ziva.

10
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:17,760
Some of population as the aggregation from EPA and school countries, we group by the Roll-Up.

11
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,250
And then copying our two fields.

12
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:43,500
Subregion, it should be first, as that is the top hierarchy and then organization regionality should

13
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,100
be second.

14
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,520
And here are the results.

15
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:58,750
We have the usual subregion ID and organization regionality totals, which would be captured in the

16
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,630
usual group by clothes anyway without any extensions.

17
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,970
Then we have the totals for the subregion with the organization region it is now.

18
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,310
And then we have the grand total.
