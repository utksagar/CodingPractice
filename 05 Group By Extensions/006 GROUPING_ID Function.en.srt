1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:07,950
The grouping ID function provides a flag for the specific subtotal or grand total that has been shown

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,890
at the root level based on your group by extension.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:18,000
It can be used in the select statement only when a group, by extension has been used, the same columns

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,600
that are included in your group, by extension, should be enclosed in the grouping ID functions parentheses

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,180
to an example of the syntax is shown on the screen.

6
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:38,620
And as you can see, we've applied a roll up on column one and column two and the grouping, it also

7
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,620
contains column one and column two in its parentheses.

8
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,890
OK, so let's say we have two columns as per the previous Syntex show.

9
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,650
Well, how would the grouping flag these?

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,060
Well, it would do it for every combination.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,960
So if the group ID field return zero, then all provided columns have been grouped.

12
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:09,050
If it returns, one in the first column has been subtitled, if it returns to and the second column

13
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,130
has been subtitled.

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,370
If it returns three, then this is the grand total.

15
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:22,540
Note that if we have three columns, we would have eight combinations, and so the group would go up

16
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:29,290
to seven for the grand total as it starts with zero and the grand total will always get the highest

17
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:29,680
number.

18
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,420
OK, so let's run our query again, where we roll up by region and subregion it and this time had the

19
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,650
group in it too.

20
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:57,000
So I will select and Vale region, Heidi, and the southern region, Heidi, and then I will add the

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,390
grouping ID with both of these columns inside of it.

22
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:20,920
Close parentheses and then get the some of the population from Libya and Isco countries and group by

23
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,790
Roll-Up.

24
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,080
And at.

25
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,940
They say as well, terminate with a semi-trailer until around.

26
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:51,930
So before I evaluate this fully, because we're doing a roll up, as I mentioned previously, I expect

27
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,360
to see the flags at zero one and three because we would not have subregion.

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,490
I'd subtotal on it, so.

29
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,280
And as you can see.

30
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:11,690
That is the case, we only see zero one and three one is where we got the region it total and three

31
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,550
is the grand total.

32
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,350
OK, so let's change this to Cube now.

33
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:30,160
And this time, I would expect to see zero one, two and three as the group it likes and that is the

34
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,590
case.

35
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:38,230
Three is the grand total, two is the subregion total one, as we've seen previously in the region,

36
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,700
it total rose.

37
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,350
And zero would just be.

38
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,720
The region and subregion, it combination's.

39
00:03:52,460 --> 00:04:00,860
Now, if I had a third column that's non-segregated, such as organization regionality, and then add

40
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:09,530
that to the grouping it and the cube extension, then I expect my grouping ID to go all the way up to

41
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,820
seven because with three columns there are eight possible combinations.

42
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,420
And since the group it starts with zero, I'd expect the grand total to be flagged as number seven.

43
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,840
So let's test that.

44
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,070
Had to cut my hair and then at that.

45
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,820
Antipas grouping idee.

46
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,470
As well as the cube function.

47
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,590
So now when I hit run.

48
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,810
We can see that the grouping is for the grand total is seven.

49
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:09,100
And if I change this to roll up, I would expect to see a lot of blank numbers, but I would still expect.

50
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:17,460
The grand total to be up to seven, because the grouping, it will always number everything based on

51
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:23,850
every possible combination, even though the Roll-Up evaluates the subtitles based on the hierarchy.

52
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,240
And as you can see.

53
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,260
We have a lot of gaps in our numbering, but when we get down to the grand total, it's still seven.
