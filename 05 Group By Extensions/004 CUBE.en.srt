1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:07,980
Cube is an extension to the group by clause that allows you to generate subtitles as well as granting

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,250
tools just like Roll-Up.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,490
However, the subtitles are generated based on all combinations of the provided columns in the Cube

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,370
extension parenthesis, there is no hierarchy unlike the Roll-Up extension.

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:31,220
So in the Syntex on the screen, we again have to non-segregated columns in our select statement, column

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:37,700
one and column two in our group because we have the cube extension with column one and column two in

7
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,450
parenthesis.

8
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:48,020
The subtitles will happen for column one and column two as a combination column one on its own.

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:56,420
Column two on its own and in the grand total, to win the column one or column two, limiting the total

10
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,140
calculation.

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:07,470
In the next example, we have three columns in the Cube extension, so now we have eight possible combinations.

12
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:15,400
So unlike the Roll-Up, where it's done based on a hierarchy, the cube extension will generate subtitles

13
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,450
for all possible combinations.

14
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,580
OK, so let's do an example using our eBay underscore pantry's table again.

15
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,930
Let's do the same previs example we did with Roll-Up where we used regionality and subregion EITE.

16
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,370
But this time we'll use the cube extension rather than the rolled up extension.

17
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:54,800
So I'm going to select and we'll regionality zero and we'll sub region wide zero sum of the population

18
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:01,040
as the aggregation from eBay and school countries.

19
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,910
By this time I'll type KUB.

20
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,000
And I will copy this.

21
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,630
Into the parenthesis for Cube, put into a single line for readability.

22
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,970
Terminating the semicolon.

23
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,570
InterOil.

24
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:33,220
So before I review this, what I expect to see would be the subtitles for the region, Idy and the subregion

25
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:39,310
I'd combination, and then for region regionality on its own and then for subregion, it is on its own

26
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,020
and in the Grand Hotel.

27
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:48,520
So as you can see, we first have the Grand Hotel where we've got nulls for the region and the subregion,

28
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:55,570
and we then have the totals for the subregion as they were nulls in the region ID field.

29
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,540
So this is the subtotal for subregion ID 10.

30
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,470
This is the subtotal for some reason, ID 20 and so on.

31
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,440
And then as I scroll down where we have Noles in the subregion, I'd feel it would be the total for

32
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,400
the region it.

33
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,610
So this is the total for region, I'd tell, which is, again, just over just over a billion.

34
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,400
And then this would be the total for region wide 20.

35
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,130
And where we have a region under subregion it populated, that will be the combination of region and

36
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,540
subregion it which would have occurred in a normal group by statement anyway.

37
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:46,850
So as you can see, unlike roller cube evaluates all combinations, if I was to change this to a up

38
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,570
right now, we would no longer be able to see the total for subregion.

39
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,820
It, as I'm about to show you.

40
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:06,070
As you can see, we no longer have the total just for the subregion it.

41
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:16,640
And that is because that gets dropped off as it's lower in the hierarchy, whereas with Cuba, all of

42
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,560
the combinations are evaluated.

43
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,020
As you can see, we now have subregion in total again.

44
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:33,730
Now, as with the roll up extension, you can also do a partial cube where you have some non-segregated

45
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,250
columns in the group by close but not in the cube extension.

46
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,830
It works pretty much as you'd expect after seeing the example on the role of lecture.

47
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,630
So I won't go over that again, but I'll leave you to investigate that in your own time.
