1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:08,370
OK, so I just wanted to clarify quickly why I'm using the Anvil formula in my queries.

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:15,420
So let's evaluate the EPA on this whole country's table and group by the region and subregion to get

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,500
the total population.

4
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,350
And here on.

5
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:52,600
Now, as I interpret the results, you can see that there is a small population of one one two six belonging

6
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:59,410
to Region 40, but it does not have a subregion ID and it's populated in not.

7
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:07,490
Now, let's see what happens when I apply a roll of extension on this query.

8
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:28,020
We seem to return a peculiar result at Regenhard, 40, we seem to have two subtitles for Regenhard.

9
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,290
Forty one with a population of around 42 million.

10
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:40,290
And one with just one one two six, but you recall, this is the same number as the sub region that

11
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,910
was populated with a known value.

12
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,200
So when you're actually trying to evaluate this, it actually looks pretty confusing.

13
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:54,690
It appears that this is the subtotal for regionality, 40, but it's not this is actually just the total

14
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,210
for region 40 with a sub region.

15
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:57,960
It is.

16
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,730
No, and that's different.

17
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,840
And hence why this field is causing confusion.

18
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:12,960
Now, if I replace the null value in the sub region ID field with a zero instead by using the Engvall

19
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,560
formula.

20
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,410
Then it will become clearer.

21
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,070
So if I apply and Val.

22
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,250
To the subregion, it field.

23
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,180
And now he run.

24
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:58,940
The null has been replaced with a zero, and now it actually becomes clearer to see here is the subtotal

25
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,980
and here is actually the valley where the region is 40.

26
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,690
But the sub region, it was previously no.

27
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,690
It's now been replaced with a zero.

28
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,780
And that is why I'm using Engvall in my columns to remove these null values as they contradict what

29
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,870
the subtotal columns are trying to show.
