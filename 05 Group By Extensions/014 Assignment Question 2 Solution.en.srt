1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:10,040
OK, so for this question, we just need to have our subtitles for all combinations of the non-segregated

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,490
fields'.

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,800
So we can use Cube instead of Roll-Up.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,170
And another requirement was to not have any no values, so we'll use the envy formula again.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,980
And on top of that, we need to show the grouping it this time, so we will use the grouping IT formula

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,930
and have the subregion ID and all region it inside it.

7
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:41,270
So we type select in the sub region wide,

8
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,780
the organization region wide.

9
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:59,150
And then the group ID formula, which will take.

10
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,080
These two columns in.

11
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,360
But then in the same line.

12
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:19,760
It is this group, Heidi, and then the aggregation, which is population from undisclosed countries.

13
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,610
We then would find the cube extension.

14
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,190
And I can actually just copy this.

15
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,510
Into that cube extension.

16
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,530
And here.

17
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,370
And here are our results.

18
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,190
And we can see from the flag.

19
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,120
That here is a subtotal with the group of three.

20
00:01:52,140 --> 00:02:02,250
Group 82 is the organization regionalised, Total Group 81 is the subregion in total, and Group Zero

21
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:07,830
is the usual subregion and organization regionality subtitles.
