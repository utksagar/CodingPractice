1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,700
Instead of using Roll-Up or Cube, you can specify your own grouping set.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:13,930
So, for example, if we wanted to return subtitles for column one and column two together and then

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:20,140
only for column two, we can specify that in the groupings that as per the slide.

4
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:30,020
Each grouping must be separated with a comma and multiple column groupings should be enclosed in parenthesis.

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:39,230
So in the next example, we have three groupings, column three and column two or one, grouping column

6
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,840
two and column one is another grouping and column one is a grouping on its own.

7
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,320
So they are generated subtitles.

8
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:58,770
OK, so let's do a grouping set for subtitles with regionality subregion and óg regionality only, but

9
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,260
not the other combinations such as Çok regionality, an organization region together.

10
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:12,540
If we use a rollup or a cube, we would get the subtitles that we don't want and sometimes you want

11
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,080
to customize the groupings.

12
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,340
So this is a perfect example to use grouping sets.

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,100
So I would type select.

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,600
Feel for region, Heidi.

15
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,740
And feel free sub region, Heidi.

16
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,680
And Bill, for her organization, regionality.

17
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:59,850
The aggregation, we should be the sum of population from undisclosed countries, and then I want to

18
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:09,180
gloopy the grouping set and this will be whatever I specify I want it to be for the combination of three,

19
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,340
these three just on their own.

20
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,000
So I limpert that into the parameters.

21
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,520
So each individual one will be treated as their own grouping.

22
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,860
So only the combinations listed here will get generated subtitles.

23
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,600
So let's get right.

24
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,220
Now, as you can see, we've got the total.

25
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,010
For region wide, the total for subregion is.

26
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:48,720
And the total for organization regionality, if I won grand totals to, then I can add that to the end

27
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,740
of the list here by just doing open and close parentheses and here run.

28
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,720
And now we also return the grand total and like I said, you can also combine columns.

29
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,720
So if I wanted the total region in the subregion, I'd combination to.

30
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,780
And then the ÓG region, it has another combination on its own.

31
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,110
I can then modify the query.

32
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,530
To be like this, I'll have regionality.

33
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:30,540
And subregion ID in parentheses, I'll have organization regionality on its own.

34
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,200
And then I will get rid of the open and close parenthesis

35
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,380
so that we don't calculate the grand to.

36
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,340
And yet ran.

37
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:52,240
So now we can see that we've got the combination for region wide and subregion where organization region

38
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:58,570
it is now and then we've got the combination for organization, region it on its own to.

39
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,660
And we only get to grouping's because that's all we specified.

40
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,190
And again, I can add the grand total.

41
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,360
And then we get back to at the end.

42
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:21,060
No, that, as with all group by requirements, all non-segregated columns in the select statement must

43
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,430
be in the group by all the group by extension.

44
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,160
So if I remove organization, region it.

45
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,980
And yet, Ron.

46
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:45,230
We get an error, but if I copy this outside of the grouping set and it run.

47
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,630
The query works fine, so that's just one thing to be aware of.
