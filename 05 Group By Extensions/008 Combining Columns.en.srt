1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:07,050
You can put multiple columns in parenthesis in your cube and roll up extensions, and they will be treated

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,330
as composite columns, meaning they will be evaluated like the single columns.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,890
So in the syntax on the left, we have three columns individually specified in the roll up extension.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,580
They get evaluated in hierarchy order as per normal.

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:32,170
But in the syntax on the right, we have column one and column two in parentheses, so they both treated

6
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,280
as a single column.

7
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:42,180
Column one and column two are evaluated along with column three as per before, but in the next level,

8
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,170
column one and column two are evaluated.

9
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:53,550
But after that, rather than having column to drop off, we lose both column one and column two and

10
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,630
get to the grand total.

11
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,520
This is an example of composite columns in your roll up and cube extensions.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,650
If you provide multiple columns in parentheses, they will get treated like they are single columns.

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,170
So in this instance, column one and column two are being treated as a single column and they will not

14
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,030
be evaluated individually.
